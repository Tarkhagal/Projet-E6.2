Report on My 200-Hour School Project: IT Park Manager, Backup System, and Networking
This document presents the detailed report of my 200-hour school project, which focused on managing an IT park, developing a backup system, and enhancing networking infrastructure. This project was conducted in the Polypeptide stand-alone environment.
I would like to extend my gratitude to Polypeptide for providing me the opportunity to undertake and complete this project.
